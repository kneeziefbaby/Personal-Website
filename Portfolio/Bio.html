                <h2><u>Brief Background</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Hi everyone! My name is Kai, and I am an "Airforce Brat" who moved to Colorado in the Winter of 2011 from Southern California. Colorado is officially home now and I guess one could say I have embraced everything the state has to offer without looking back! This includes learning about and exploring a huge IT and tech community.

                <h2><u>Academic Interests</u></h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a student at Colorado State University with a graduation date of Spring '24. I initially went to school for engineering but found it not to be a natural fit for me. With time off from school, I have developed a hunger to aspire for more and develop a career that I can be proud of. The Covid-19 pandemic brought me the perfect opportunity to reevaluate life and choose a promising career. My analytical and inquisitive mindset, coupled with my love for computers and everything about them has led me to choosing a career in computer information systems (CIS) specializing in cybersecurity. For me, it is not just important to know how systems and computers work, I want to know how to safeguard networks and protect everyone from malicious attackers.

                <h2><u>Hobbies</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Staying active and playing sports are two of my top Hobbies; really anything that involves teamwork or competition. Naturally, living in Colorado has turned me into a hiker and snowboarder. But, I also am also an avid fan of history and enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures. When I am not in front of a computer screen I also like to cook or garden to relax.
