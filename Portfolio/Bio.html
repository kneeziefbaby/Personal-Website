				<h2><u>Brief Background</u></h2>
				
					Hi everyone!  My name is Kai and I am an "Airforce Brat" who moved to Colorado in the Winter of 2011 from Southern California. Colorado is officially
					home now and I guess one could say I have embraced everything the state has to offer without looking back! This includes learning about and exploring a
					huge IT and tech community. 
			
			</p>

			<p>
				<h2><u>Academic Interests</u></h2>
					
					I am currently a student at Colorado State University with a graduation date of Spring '24.  I initially went 
					to school for engineering, but found it not to be a natural fit for me.  With time off from school I have developed
				 	a hunger to aspire for more and develop a career that I can be proud of.The Covid-19 pandemic brought me
				  	the perfect opportunity to reevaluate life and choose a promising career. My analytical and inquisitive mindset,
				   	coupled with my love for computers and everything about them has lead me to choosing a career in computer information systems (CIS)
					specializing in cybersecurity. For me, it is not just important to know how systems and computers work, I want to know how to 
					safeguard networks and protect everyone from malicious attackers.

				<h2><u>Hobbies</u></h2>
				Staying active and playing sports are two of my top Hobbies; really anything that involves teamwork or competition.

				and enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures. When I am not in front of a computer screen I also like to cook 
				or garden to relax.
